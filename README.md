# jtag-wire-adapter

[![Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-design-blue?style=plastic)]()

A compact adapter board for connecting SEGGER J-Link debug probes to generic JTAG/SWD targets using a set of flying wires.

### Key features

* Snug-fit debug probe connector
* 7 colored flying wires for target connection. Length approx. 10 cm
* Wire-color assignments printed on silkscreen
* Strain-relief and heatshrink tubing for durability

## Overview

This adapter can be used to interface a SEGGER J-Link debug probe to a generic JTAG or SWD target, using .1" pin header flying wires. This low cost solution can be especially useful for academic users of J-Link EDU probes, as it doesn't require special connector hardware to be fitted on target project boards.
