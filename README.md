### Key features

* Snug-fit debug probe connector
* .100" pin header for flying wire connection
* Signal assignment printed on silk screen

## Overview

This adapter can be used to interface a SEGGER J-Link debug probe to a generic JTAG or SWD target, using .1" *DuPont*-style jumper wires. This low cost solution can be especially useful for academic users of J-Link EDU probes, as it doesn't require special connector hardware to be fitted on target project boards.
